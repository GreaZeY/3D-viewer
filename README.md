# Supported Files

- gLTF/GLB : gLTF/GLB is a neutral, open source format. The Khronos Group created this format for 3D web, AR, VR, Games and 3D advertising. Its the first really well-defined standard for 3D.

- FBX : FBX is a proprietary 3D file format. Kardara originally developed this format. AutoDesk then purchased them in 2006 and continued supporting FBX. It is widely used in the film and video game industry. 

- OBJ : OBJ is a neutral 3D format when used as an ASCII variant. However, when used as a binary variant, it is proprietary. 3D printing, graphics, and 3D scanning all use this file format thanks in part to its ability to store geometry as well as color and texture information. 

- STL : This 3D file format is most popular for 3D printing. It is a neutral 3D file format. This file format only stores geometry information.
